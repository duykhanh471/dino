*This app is still in development*
I just use this as a way to learn new techniques and experiment some new features. Feel free to try it out!

When I finish it I will upload the screenshot later :D!

## Things I use (and intend to use too!) in this project
- MVVM Architecture
- Room Database and Jetpack Datastore
- Navigation Component with SafeArgs
- Dependency Injection with Dagger/Hilt
- Coroutines, LiveData, ViewModel, Lifecycle 
- Views as UI, I might migrate to Jetpack soon xD
